## How to test the code for yourself

Each exercise has a function that will run it entirely. For example, E1() will run all the code for Exercise 1.
Feel free to explore the code on your own.

## Notes

- Answers in Exercise 2:
  1. If the number is too high(420,000 for example), it will result in Stack Overflow. The program will try to use more memory than there is available.
  2. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It does, however, need an exit condition whithout which the program would enter an infinite loop.
  ___
- Exercise 3: All function calls have been commented out to avoid being overwhelmed with outputs at runtime. Please uncomment each of them before testing them. We recommend only uncommenting one at a time for sake of readability.
  ___
- In Exercise 4, instead of printing _ for horizontal lines, we decided to print __.
The width of _ is half the height of |, so we wouldn't get a square for a 4,4 rectangle.
Still, E4() will have the expected behaviour because our changes are in E4_corrected(). Please do test them both.
  Finally, here is the output that was asked in the subject:
